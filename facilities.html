            <h3>SPACE & DESIGN</h3>
            <p>The podtels are built to mimic our idea of a space ship that landed on planet Mars, the next frontier for
                humans. How do
                we do that in limited space and without compromise? The podtels are highly organised with plenty of
                storage spaces and
                organised modules that solve every need humans have in their daily lives.</p>
